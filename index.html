                The Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Teaching and Learning) announced on 3 August 2023 that the University will introduce some new policies to fully integrate GenAI in Teaching and Learning.  Please note that HKU SPACE will follow the University’s policy as per previous announcements from the Deputy Director (Academic Services) on the School’s staff intranet.Colleges have been tasked to follow up to introduce AI elements in programme and course curricula for the 2023/24 academic year.

                Andrew Brass, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of Manchester, pointed out that from the school's perspective, artificial intelligence cannot be mandatory and requires schools to work closely with students to implement guidance. If there are restrictions, schools also need to explain clearly to students why, otherwise someone will always find other ways to do it.

                On 2023 April 3, the University of Tokyo issued an open letter to all teachers and students in the name of the vice president. The open letter stated that ChatGPT is not a search software, but a "talking" system. Therefore, students' dissertations and academic reports cannot be used. Use ChatGPT to complete it, because the articles completed by ChatGPT are written using long-term accumulated learning knowledge, and are likely to involve issues such as information leakage and copyright infringement. The open letter requires teachers to fully understand the functions of ChatGPT and carefully review dissertations and Academic report.

                According to HKBBU academic registry, given the proliferation of generative AI tools and their utility in teaching and learning, in alignment with our principles, the recommended approach is that students are allowed to perform the assessed assignment tasks with assistance from generative AI tools. Any such use must align with the University's academic integrity guidelines for students on academic integrity as well as the guidelines and instructions from the respective schools, faculties, departments and course instructors in order to ensure students are able to demonstrate achievement of PILOs and CILOs.

            <h3>1,<u>Assistance</u></h3>
            <p>The use of artificial intelligence can help teachers simplify their tasks, from creating lesson plans to generating student project ideas. With assistance from artificial intelligence, teachers can gain more time to spend with their students.</p>
            <h3>2,<u>knowledge</u></h3>
            <p>With its characteristics of massive, real-time updates, fast retrieval, and personalized learning, artificial intelligence can far surpass traditional teachers in knowledge storage. It can store and process large amounts of data and quickly adapt to new information. At the same time, it can also contact a large number of online learners and collect their data for understanding and analysis. These advantages make artificial intelligence an efficient and effective knowledge dissemination tool, which can provide students with the most comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge base.</p>
            <h3>3,<u>Individualization</u></h3>
            <p>AI can provide students with one-on-one personalized education. This is equivalent to each of us getting a teacher, and you can ask questions to it anytime and anywhere. According to banjamin bloom's 2 significant study, one-to-one education can improve the average performance of students compared with other one-to-many education.</p>

            <div class="box2"><p align = "center">Students can use ChatGPT to write entire essays, answer quiz questions, or do their homework. Ironically, now there are AI programs that can detect AI writing to help teachers determine if their students are cheating. But sometimes those programs may falsely identify a student's original work as plagiarism.</p></div>
            <div class="box2"><p align = "center">The data of AI may come from various documents, books, etc. on the Internet. When AI integrates this information and outputs it to the user, who should own the copyright? And when we use a large amount of data to train AI, should we pay attention to copyright issues? If the use of AI does not have a clear copyright regulation, it will damage the rights and interests of authors and be detrimental to academic development.</p></div>
            <div class="box2"><p align = "center">According to a survey released by the Ministry of Education of China in 2023, there are as many as 18.9178 million full-time teachers in China. With the powerful database and algorithms of AI, a large number of education-related practitioners may face the risk of unemployment.</p></div>
